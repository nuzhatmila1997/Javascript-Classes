~Statement~

** Each line is a statement.
** In js statements are separated by semi-colon (;) [best practice]
** Modern js supports code execution without ";" after each line
** VM detects statements and separates them based on newline
** If next line starts with "[", then it will get an error if previous statement doesn't have ";"
** If line ends with operators (e.g. "+","-") js will not think it is the end of line. 
It will search for the next operand.
