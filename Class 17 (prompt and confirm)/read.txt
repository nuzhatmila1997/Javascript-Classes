~User Interaction: Prompt and Confirm~

** When alert is shown all other executions are halt until ok is pressed.
** These are called modals. These modals are generated by modals.
** User defined modals can also be created by html, css.

--:Prompt:--

** Another modal used by browser is 'prompt'. This is used to take input from users. E.g., 
        prompt("Enter your name: ");
** On click ok/ cancel, prompt will give me a value.
    # On click cancel, returns null.
    # On click ok without vlue, returns ""/ empty string. 
** We can pass a second argument to prompt to set an initial/ default value (on cancel returns null)
        prompt("Enter your name: ", "Ex.John Doe");

    ''' In older versions of ie, there might be an issue if 2nd arg is not passed (default is set to undefied.)
        To solve this issue, prompt can be used following way.
            prompt("Enter your name: ", ""); 
    '''
** Prompt values are stored as strings.
** Onclick cancel, type will return object.

--:Confirm:--

** Another modal used by browser is 'confirm'. This is used to take input from users and returns boolean. E.g., 
        confirm("Enter your name: ");
** On click ok/ cancel, prompt will give a value.
    # On click ok, returns true.
    # On click cancel, returns false.
