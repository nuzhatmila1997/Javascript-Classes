~Variables~

** To store any kind of information or data
** A variable cannot store more than one value. If assigned to new value, previous data gets lost.
** Variable names can have letters ([a-z/A-Z]), numbers(0-9) and some specific special characters ($,_).
    → Cannot start with numbers. [e.g. 1name → invalid, name1 → valid]
    → Best way to declare variables is to use Camel Case. [e.g. myName]
** Variables are case sensitive. [myname and myName are two different variables]
** Reserved keywords are not allowed to be used as var name [e.g. let, if, for, while etc.]
** Variable Declaration Syntax: let x; → it means I created a variable named x. 
** Define Variable Syntax: x = 5;
** Declare and Define in the same line syntax: let x=5; [preferred]
** Multiple variables can be declared and defined in the same line.
** Alternate variable Declaration Syntax: var x = 5; [previously used. not recommended]
** If run in strict mode, it will not execute if a variable is defined without declaration. E.g.,
        name = "Mila";
        alert(name); 
    ## The above lines of code will be execute if 'use strict' statement is not written

        'use strict';
         name = "Mila";
         alert(name); 
    ## The above lines of code will not execute because v8 is running js on strict mode
