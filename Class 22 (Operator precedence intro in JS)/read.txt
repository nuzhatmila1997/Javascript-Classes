~Operator Precedence~

** Operator and operands combinely make expression. E.g., 2+3*4
** If multiple oprators are present in an expression, operations are executed according to the operator priorities/ precedence.
** Paranthesis (), {}, [] has the highest precedence.
** Then **
** Then unary +
** Then *, /, %
** Then binary +, -
*** If same precedence are used --> then left to right
