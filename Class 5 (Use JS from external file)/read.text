** When external js files are used, browsers store them (in cache).
** Then the js scripts are run from cache.
** If page is reloaded, then js scripts run from cache memory. Thus it becomes faster.
** Users can call multiple js files.
** If multiple pages include the same js file, then on load one web page, the js file is stored to browser cache.
If other file is loaded then the js is called from the browser cache.
