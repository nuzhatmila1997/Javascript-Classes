~Unary Plus(+)~

** Unary + also works as a type caster.
** Casts to number.
    let num = "2";
    num = +2;
    alert(typeof num); --> number
** +"2" is equivalent to Number("2");
    let strToNum = +"5" + +"5"; [from left: unary plus, operand, binary plus, unary plus, operand. (euivalent to Number("5")+Number("5"))]
** In precedence, unary plus in higher. So at first, the strings will be converted to number then addition eill occur.
