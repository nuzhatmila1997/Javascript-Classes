~Typeof~

** Previously we discussed about variables different data types where we could store only one value.
** These types are called Premitive datatypes.
** We can check the types of variables by an operator -> typeof. E.g.,
    # Using type of as functional form:
        let myName = "Mila";
        console.log(typeof(myName)); // console will show string [typeof(myName) --> funtional form]
    
    # Using operator form:
        let myName = "Mila";
        console.log(typeof myName); // console will show string [typeof myName --> operator form]

    # Why use typeof?
    â‡’ Say, user didn't enter a string type input. Suppose name is assigned to null. In that case typeof name will show object. Thus it can be identified that user has not input the right data.
