~JS Strict Mode~

** Used in modern JS.
** To strictly verify by VMs (e.g., v8)
** Used to invalid usage of variables.
** The statement 'use strict' has to be written in the very first line of JS file.
Otherwise the file won't be considered to execute strictly by the VM.
** If run in strict mode, it will not execute if a variable is defined without declaration. E.g.,
        name = "Mila";
        alert(name); 
    ## The above lines of code will be execute if 'use strict' statement is not written

        'use strict';
         name = "Mila";
         alert(name); 
    ## The above lines of code will not execute because v8 is running js on strict mode
